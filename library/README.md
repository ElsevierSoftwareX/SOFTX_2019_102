# DfAnalyzer libraries: dfa-lib-cpp and dfa-lib-python

Since the most of our computational scientists use the programming languages C++ and Python , we develop two libraries to make easier the addition of DfAnalyzer calls in scientific applications, named as dfa-lib-cpp and dfa-lib-python. In this regard, we also deliver a [documentation of dfa-lib in C++ or **dfa-lib-cpp**](https://dfa-lib-cpp-docs.herokuapp.com/) and a [documentation of dfa-lib in Python or **dfa-lib-python**](https://dfa-lib-python-docs.herokuapp.com/).

### C++ library

1. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), the GNU Compiler Collection. (Please consider their [installation guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/))
2. [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. (Please read their [installation instructions](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html))
3. [boost](https://www.boost.org/), a package of free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

### Python library

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/), Python language interpreter version >= 3.5.2
